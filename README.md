## About Me

Hi, I’m Verda Batool, currently pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence at LUMS, with a strong interest in building real-world, user-focused AI products. My background sits at the intersection of Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Data Science, and I enjoy turning complex problems into practical, scalable solutions.

At Careem (an Uber company), I worked as a Data Analyst in the Acquisition & Market Ops team. I led initiatives that improved early-life driver retention by 30%, automated acquisition dashboards, and built systems that directly influenced growth in Pakistan’s major cities. Before that, at Maqsad, I focused on data-driven content strategy, helping improve user engagement in the EdTech space.
