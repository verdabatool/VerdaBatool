## About Me

Hi, I’m Verda Batool, currently pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence at LUMS, with a strong interest in building real-world, user-focused AI products. My background sits at the intersection of data engineering, machine learning, NLP, and product development, and I enjoy turning complex problems into practical, scalable solutions.

At Careem (an Uber company), I worked as a Data Analyst in the Acquisition & Market Ops team. I led initiatives that improved early-life driver retention by 30%, automated acquisition dashboards, and built systems that directly influenced growth in Pakistan’s major cities. Before that, at Maqsad, I focused on data-driven content strategy, helping improve user engagement in the EdTech space.


I’ve also worked on independent projects like JobMate, a culture-aware job recommendation system, and DeepChoice, a multimodal AI shopping assistant powered by LLM agents — both designed with scalability and user experience in mind.


I’m currently exploring how LLM agents can power smarter, domain-specific assistants that blend reasoning, retrieval, and personalization.
