## About Me

Hi, I’m Verda Batool, currently pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence at LUMS, with a strong interest in building real-world, user-focused AI products. My background sits at the intersection of data engineering, machine learning, NLP, and product development, and I enjoy turning complex problems into practical, scalable solutions.

At Careem (an Uber company), I worked as a Data Analyst in the Acquisition & Market Ops team. I led initiatives that improved early-life driver retention by 30%, automated acquisition dashboards, and built systems that directly influenced growth in Pakistan’s major cities. Before that, at Maqsad, I focused on data-driven content strategy, helping improve user engagement in the EdTech space.


I’ve also worked on independent projects like JobMate, a culture-aware job recommendation system, and DeepChoice, a multimodal AI shopping assistant powered by LLM agents — both designed with scalability and user experience in mind.


I’m currently exploring how LLM agents can power smarter, domain-specific assistants that blend reasoning, retrieval, and personalization.

## Education

## Projects

 ### [1. JOBMATE - AN AI POWERED JOB RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM](https://github.com/verdabatool/JobMate)


  JobMate is a job recommendation platform that aggregates open positions from 4 major job portals, enabling users to discover roles beyond skills, factoring in preferences like company culture, flexibility, and work-life balance. Hence, unlocking work opportunities personalized to skills and non-technical preferences.
  
  •	Developed and containerized an end-to-end data pipeline using **Docker and Apache Airflow**, automating data ingestion, transformation, semantic search, and deployment workflows.
  
  •	Ingested 850K+ job listings from Kaggle using its API, storing data in **AWS S3** in partitioned Parquet format to support efficient querying and downstream ML tasks.
  
  •	Employed **BERT-based MiniLM** embeddings to convert job descriptions and user inputs into semantic vectors for culture-aware job matching.
  
  •	Delivered solution via a React-based frontend that consumed model outputs and presented real-time, personalized job recommendations.
  

### [2. DEEPCHOICE: AN AI POWERED SHOPPING ASSISTANT FOR ECOMMERCE](https://github.com/verdabatool/DeepChoice_)

  DeepChoice provides an innovative shopping experience to users by giving product recommendations based on user descriptions, saving users the hassle of going through hundreds of unrelated search results. It also automates the resolution of user complaints (albeit the ones requiring human intervention) and gives real time responses to user questions and queries.
  
  •	Engineered a coordinated system of LLM agents using CrewAI to handle distinct customer tasks (FAQs, complaints, and personalized recommendations) under a central orchestration logic, supporting multimodal inputs (text + image captioning).
  
  •	Fine-tuned RoBERTa model for achieving high accuracy and responsiveness in real-world queries.
  
  •	Used Gemini 1.5 Flash and LLaMA 4 Scout 17B (16E Instruct) for captioning and reasoning.
  
  •	Used evaluation metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE-L to score recommendation quality, BERTScore for semantic similarity in FAQ answers, and Precision, Recall, F1, and Accuracy for evaluating complaint classification.
  
  •	Delivered a fast, responsive AI shopping assistant capable of generating context-aware product suggestions, handling support issues, and answering queries - all through a unified interface (FastAPI front end and backend in Next.js).
